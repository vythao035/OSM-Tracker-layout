## Maxspeed layout
This layout is designed to map maxspeeds when driving. It has two layout
formats: "landscape" and "portrait".

Landscape method is designed, so that the outer borders have the most common
signs. I use this with my motorbike.

In portrait mode buttons are sorted. This is for car usage.

This layout has a restricted number of possibilities for a specific task
only. Additional information can only be added using the three generic
buttons in the main panel.
